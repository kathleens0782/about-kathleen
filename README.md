Am an artist who specifically works on character designs and concept art, hope to make video games as a hobby (_my biggest project is going to be a half rhythm game/ half platformer game_), 
am also a drummer (_I've been playing for more than a year now_), also plan to be a webcomic artist, or a drummer in a gig band, have indeed traveled outside of NY, love wolves tigers, and red pandas as my top three favorite animals,
Love milk as my favorite drink, while pasta is my favorite food, _loves_ to watch cartoons and anime (_name one and I've probably seen an episode of it, or heard of it_), am in 11th grade, 
likes meta-jokes (_jokes that break the forth wall, or poke fun at itself_), am starting to write too many facts, and have a twin sister and an older brother.
