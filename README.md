If you want to get to know more about me, I:

Am an artist who specifically works on character designs and concept art, hope to make video games as a hobby (my biggest project is going to be a half rhythm game/ half platformer game), 
am also a drummer (I've been playing for more than a year now), also plan to be a webcomic artist, or a drummer in a gig band, have indeed traveled outside of NY, love wolves, tigers, and red pandas as my top three favorite animals,
Love milk as my favorite drink, while pasta is my favorite food, love to watch cartoons and anime (name one and I've probably seen an episode of it, or heard of it), am in 11th grade, 
likes meta-jokes (jokes that break the forth wall, or poke fun at itself), am starting to write too many facts, have a twin sister and an older brother.
